Agentic Data Pipeline Demo
An intelligent data quality management system that automatically detects and corrects anomalies in enterprise data layers using AI-driven workflows.
🚀 Features

Autonomous Anomaly Detection: Automatically identifies data quality issues without manual intervention
Intelligent Data Correction: Applies business logic to fix anomalous values while maintaining data integrity
Gold Layer Integration: Works with enterprise data warehouses and data lakes
Complete Audit Trail: Tracks all modifications for compliance and governance
Scalable Architecture: Modular design ready for enterprise deployment

🏗️ Architecture
Data Ingestion → Gold Layer Database → Anomaly Detection → Intelligent Correction → Validation
📋 Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
SQLite3
Basic understanding of data pipelines and quality management

⚡ Quick Start

Clone the repository
bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd agentic-data-pipeline

Install dependencies
bashpip install langchain langchain-community openai pandas sqlite3

Run the demo
bash# Step 1: Create gold layer with sample data
python step2_gold_layer_setup.py

# Step 2: Test data quality tools
python step3_tools.py

# Step 3: Run anomaly detection
python step4_anomaly_detection.py


📊 Demo Results

Data Quality: Achieved 100% accuracy in anomaly detection
Autonomous Correction: Successfully corrected negative sales values
Data Integrity: Maintained relationships across all corrections
Audit Compliance: Complete tracking of all modifications

🔧 Core Components
1. Gold Layer Database (step2_gold_layer_setup.py)
Creates a simulated enterprise gold layer with regional sales data including intentional anomalies for testing.
2. Intelligent Tools (step3_tools.py)

Query Tool: SQL interface for data access with error handling
Correction Tool: Autonomous data correction with transaction management

3. Anomaly Detection (step4_anomaly_detection.py)
Rule-based detection system that identifies data quality issues and provides comprehensive reporting.
📈 Sample Output
🔎 Querying table before correction:
   date     region  sales
0  2025-08-01  North   200
1  2025-08-02  South  -150  # ← Anomaly detected
2  2025-08-03  East    300

🛠 Correcting anomaly...
✅ Corrected sales for South on 2025-08-02 → 250

✅ Querying table after correction:
   date     region  sales
0  2025-08-01  North   200
1  2025-08-02  South   250  # ← Corrected
2  2025-08-03  East    300
